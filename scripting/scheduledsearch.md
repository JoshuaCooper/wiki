# Scheduled searches

It is often advantageous to perform searches automatically, for instance running a search every morning to detect malicious behavior from the previous night. Using Gravwell's scheduled searches functionality, searches can be run on customized scheduled.

The scheduling feature allows the user to schedule both regular searches and [search scripts](scriptingsearch.md).
