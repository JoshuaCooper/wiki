# Changelog for version 4.1.0

### Released January 6 2021

## Web UI Changes
* Actionables now support templates with multiple variables
* Add Web UI based data ingester

## Backend Changes
* Added indexer/webserver API version negotiation - SEE NOTE BELOW - THIS HAS POTENTIAL DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS
* Implemented Compound Queries, enabling sequential, in-order, queries that share data
* Added `enrich` module
* Updated `dump` module to support a temporal mode
* Queries now skip bad/corrupted blocks in shards, continue searching, issue a warning instead of just aborting the query
* Added the `repack` command to the CLI
* Changed the `CEF` module to not require non-header values to be prefixed with `Ext.`
* Fixed an issue where dynamically negotiated tags were not going to the correct well when using wildcards on that well

## Ingesters & Ingest Library Changes
* Implemented a Cisco ISE log preprocessor

## General/Miscellaneous
* Windows installers are now fully signed

## Notes
* Beginning in version 4.1.0, the Gravwell indexer and webserver now negotiate and enforce an API version. This means that a 4.1.0 webserver cannot connect to an older indexer and vice versa. Consider all indexer and webserver versions before upgrading.
